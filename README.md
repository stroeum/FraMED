FraMED is FRActal Model of Electrical Discharges in the atmosphere using a variety of boundary conditions and other parameters.  Data for each discharge is stored in a unique subfolder which resides in the same directory as the executable.  Interim results and other announcements are written to the console as well as to file.

To install, simple copy and paste the executable to the desired location.

Prior to a new run:
 * Ensure the presence of an empty "results" folder in the root directory; 
 * Remove the summary.txt file from the results folder if applicable.
